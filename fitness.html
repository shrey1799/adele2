    <h1>3 steps to body-transformation success</h1>
    <p>
      Geracimo, 48, says the most important thing to remember on any fitness journey is not to rush the process.
"My main piece of advice to anyone wanting to make healthy changes to themselves is to be fully committed to the whole process and above all else to be patient," he told Insider.
"Fast results tend to be fleeting. Slow and gradual tends to last longer."
If Adele's new look has inspired you, the good news is that Geracimo says transformations "are really not that complicated."
"All that is required is belief in yourself that you can do it, consistency in your actions, and discipline in your routine," he said.
There are three key factors that will determine your success, according to Geracimo:

      <li>A well-balanced, inclusive food plan.</li>
      <li>Exercising regularly, getting your heart rate up, and going outside your comfort zone.</li>
      <li>Getting proper restful sleep to allow your body and mind to repair and recover.</li>
    </ol>
